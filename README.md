# Windows
Windows versions are built under Borland C++ Builder.

# Linux
Linux versions are written for fun. To compile it, use the following command:
```
gcc -o <output_filename> <source_code_files> -lpthread -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```
The OpenGL headers can be found under /usr/include/GL, if you have mesa installed, that is.
